To help me create this program the following references were used:

https://www.pygame.org/docs/
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpYz-q1lxu8

the YouTube video is from freecodecamp.org and it was created by 
Keith Galli.

I used his framework and I tried my best to make it my own unique program
but obviously it is a basic game.  I tried to get fancy with
winCheck, but for some reason I currently have a brain fart for a more
efficient algorithm for finding the downward sloping diagonal wins.
